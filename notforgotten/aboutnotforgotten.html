      About Us
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      We are a group of four students from New York University.
      <br>
      <br>
      We believe people too easily <strong>forget</strong> tragedies. This shouldn't happen. This mustn't happen. We've had enough of school shootings, of ignorance, of inaction, of nonchalance, of pain, of heroism, of waking up in the morning numbed by the death of twenty elementary students, of sacrifice, of fresh blood, of that lump in our throats, of those tears in our eyes. School shootings must be stopped, somehow, some day. We start by not forgetting.
      <br>
      <br>
      We must not forget them:
